- 👋 Hi, I’m @DataMadeEEZY
- 👀 I’m interested in all things DATA! I like seeing the big picture (lifecycle) of data being created and then moved from point A to point Z with all the intricacies between!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced SQL concepts, Google Cloud (GCP), Linux, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on end to end projects and upcoming challenges for those that dare!
